# Predicting-Flight-Delays-with-Error-Calculation-using-Machine-Learned-Classifiers

## Project Overview
Accurate flight delay prediction is fundamental to establish the more efficient airline business. An important business of airlines is to get customer satisfaction. Their prediction is crucial during the decision-making process for all players of commercial aviation. Due to bad weather, a mechanical reason, and the late arrival of the aircraft to the point of departure, flights delay and lead to customer dissatisfaction. A predictive model of on-time arrival flight is proposed with using flight data and weather data. In this paper we are using machine learning models such as Decision Tree Regression, Bayesian Ridge, Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Regression we predict whether the arrival of a particular flight will be delayed or not. By using hyper tuning techniques we can increase the accuracy of the machine learning models.  In this Project additionally for the above mentioned algorithms we use (SVM) Support vector machine and increase the accuracy of this algorithm using hyper tuning techniques.
## EXISTING METHOD
Much research has been done on studying flight delays. In past people have used a rule based system for predicting flight delays based on weather and maintenance parameters. Many have also used machine learning methods like logistic regression for flight delay predictions.
## DISADVANTAGES:
•	Low accuracy.
•	High Variance.
•	Requires highly trained staff.
•	Expensive.
## PROPOSED METHOD
Accurate flight delay prediction is fundamental to establish the more efficient airline business. An important business of airlines is to get customer satisfaction. The existing methods require highly skilled people and hence are costly to implement as it requires manually selecting features for prediction. In this paper, using machine learning models such as Decision Tree Regression, Bayesian Ridge, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression and SVM we predict whether the arrival of a particular flight will be delayed or not.

## ADVANTAGES:
•	Higher Accuracy.
•	Low variance.
•	Does not require highly trained staff to operate.
•	Cheaper to implement.
